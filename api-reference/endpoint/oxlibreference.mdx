# Overextended Library Installation

* To enable the ox_lib library inside of your resource just add @ox_lib/init.lua as a shared_script in your fxmanifest.lua file like below.
<CodeGroup>
```lua fxmanifest.lua
shared_scripts {
    '@ox_lib/init.lua',
}
```
</CodeGroup>

## Building a Overextended Ui 

* Please visit Ox_Libs Docs to understand the ways to do this here https://overextended.dev/ox_lib#building-the-ui

## Menu Registration

* To define a menu in RSG, use the lib.registerContext function. This function sets up the menu's structure, including its title, options, and associated actions.

```lua 
lib.registerContext({
    id = "example_menu",
    title = "Example Menu",
    options = {
        {
            title = "Open Inventory",
            icon = "fa-solid fa-box",
            description = "View your inventory items.",
            event = "inventory:client:open",
            arrow = true
        },
        {
            title = "Toggle Duty",
            icon = "fa-solid fa-shield",
            event = "job:client:toggleDuty"
        }
    }
})
```
# Showing the Menu
* Once registered, the menu can be displayed using the lib.showContext function.

Syntax:

```lua
lib.showContext("unique_menu_id")
```

# Localization

* Text elements such as title and description can use localization functions for multi-language support. Example:

## Notifications

* Custom notifications with a lot of styling options.

Example:

<CodeGroup>
  ```lua client.lua
 lib.notify({ title = 'SOME TITLE', type = 'success', icon = 'SOME FAS FA ICON', iconAnimation = 'shake', duration = 7000 })
  ```
  ```lua server.lua
  TriggerClientEvent('ox_lib:notify', src, {title = 'SOME TITLE', type = 'error', icon = 'SOME FAS FA ICON', iconAnimation = 'shake', duration = 7000 })
  ```
</CodeGroup>

<Info>
Always try to use language locales! e.g. (these are typically a json format)
</Info>

<CodeGroup>
```lua
locale('SOMETITLE')
```
```js en.json
"SOMETITLE" : "THIS IS A LOCALE FILE"
```
</CodeGroup>
