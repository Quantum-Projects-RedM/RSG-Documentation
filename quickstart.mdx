<Accordion title="Ace Permissions?" defaultOpen={false} icon="shield">
  Aces are the built-in permissions system provided by CFX. They allow for creating new nodes which have aces attached to them. This permission system consists of aces & principals. Essentially think of a tree with branches. We have our ace that we create and then each branch would be our principal which inherits the permissions of our ace
</Accordion>

<Check>
  txAdmin should automatically set the server owner as the highest permission level

## Server Config

Learn how to update your docs locally and deploy them to the public.

### Edit and preview

* At the bottom of your server.cfg file you will see a permissions section



```lua
## Permissions ##
add_ace group.admin command allow # allow all commands
add_principal identifier.license:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX rsgcore.god # << your rockstar licence  
add_principal identifier.license:XXXXXXXXXXXXXXX group.admin # << your rockstar licence

# Resources
add_ace resource.rsg-core command allow # Allow rsg-core to execute commands

# Gods
add_ace rsgcore.god command allow # Allow all commands

# Inheritance
add_principal rsgcore.god group.admin # Allow gods access to the main admin group used to get all default permissions
add_principal rsgcore.god rsgcore.admin # Allow gods access to admin commands
add_principal rsgcore.admin rsgcore.mod # Allow admins access to mod commands

```

## Different types of identifiers

* **FiveM ID**

* **Rockstar license (what rsgcore uses)**

* **Discord ID**

To get a FiveM or GTA license you can look up the player on your txAdmin web panel

**If they are currently connected to the server, you will get all available identifiers**

### After gathering the desired identifiers, go to your server.cfg and add the `Players` section as shown below

<Info>
  rsgcore.god and group.admin share the same permissions you can use either one.

  <Accordion icon="github" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, we created a repository on your Github with
    your docs content. You can find this repository on our
    [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). To clone the repository
    locally, follow these
    [instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
    in your terminal.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Preview changes">
    Previewing helps you make sure your changes look as intended. We built a
    command line interface to render these changes locally. 1. Install the
    [Mintlify CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/mintlify) to preview the
    documentation changes locally with this command: `npm i -g mintlify`
    2\. Run the following command at the root of your documentation (where
    `mint.json` is): `mintlify dev`
  </Accordion>

### Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="message-bot" title="Install our Github app">
    Our Github app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you
    don't need to manage deployments yourself. You can find the link to install on
    your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com). Once the bot has been
    successfully installed, there should be a check mark next to the commit hash
    of the repo.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion icon="rocket" title="Push your changes">
    [Commit and push your changes to
    Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-git/pushing-commits-to-a-remote-repository#about-git-push)
    for your changes to update in your docs site. If you push and don't see that
    the Github app successfully deployed your changes, you can also manually
    update your docs through our [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
  </Accordion>
