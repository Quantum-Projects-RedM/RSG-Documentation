## Download the CFX Artifacts

1. Go to[ Windows Server Build](https://runtime.fivem.net/artifacts/fivem/build_server_windows/master/) and download the Latest Recommended or Newest it doesn't really matter. (*I would recommend making sure to have* [*WinRAR* ](https://www.rarlab.com/download.htm)*for this*)

2. Open the file that you just downloaded that should be named something with **server.7z**

3. Optionally create a folder in your `C:\` drive

   1. Create folder `C:\SERVER_NAME`

   2. Create folder `C:\SERVER_NAME\Artifacts`

   3. Create folder `C:\SERVER_NAME\Server`

4. Extract from the server.7z everything into the `C:\SERVER_NAME\Artifacts` folder we created

## Starting your new RedM Server&#x20;

1. Find the file called `FXServer.exe` and double click it, this will launch the TXAdmin launcher for you to get started

2. In the Launch you should get your browser opened with TXAdmin asking you to link your account, link and proceed.&#x20;

3. After you completed this you should see a TXAdmin Launch setup page follow the instructions on page for Server Name etc.

4. Once you get to Deployment type you will choose **Remote URL Template**![](image2.avif)

5. Enter the following Recipe link : &#x20;

   1. [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rexshack-RedM/txAdminRecipe/main/rsgcore.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Rexshack-RedM/txAdminRecipe/main/rsgcore.yaml)

6. Click `Change Path` and enter the following file path `C:\SERVER_NAME\Server` and click `Save` then follow on screen instructions to continue

7. You should be in `Recipe Deployer` , review the recipe and click `Next `

8. Now we are almost ready to launch our newly created server, now enter the key you just made on the [Keymaster](https://keymaster.fivem.net/) where it says `License Key` and then select `Run Recipe`&#x20;

9. Congratulations! ðŸŽ‰ Your Server is now ready, once the Recipe is ready `Click Save & Run Server`![](image3.avif)
