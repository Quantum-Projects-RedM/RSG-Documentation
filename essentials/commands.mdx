## RSGCore.Commands.Add

This function allows you to register a command with a specified user level

```lua
RSGCore.Commands.Add(name, help, arguments, argsrequired, callback, permission, ...)
```

* name: `string`

* help: `string`

* arguments: `table`

* argsrequired: `boolean`

* callback: `function`

* permission: `string`

Example:

```lua
local arguments = {
    { name = 'arg 1', help = 'This will give helpful hints on what arg is for' },
    { name = 'arg 2', help = 'This will give helpful hints on what arg is for' }
}

local argsRequired = true -- if this is true the command won't work without args entered

RSGCore.Commands.Add('test', 'Trigger a test command', arguments, argsRequired, function(source)
    print('Congrats, you made a test command that anyone can trigger!')
end, 'user')
```

## RSGCore.Commands.Refresh

This function will trigger a refresh of all commands suggestions. This is helpful for when setting permissions to a higher level, it will refresh the suggestions list so the player can now see the new commands they have access to!

```lua
RSGCore.Commands.Refresh(source)
```

* source: `number`

Example:

```
RegisterCommand('refreshCommands', function()
    RSGCore.Commands.Refresh(source)
    print('You have refreshed all command suggestions for yourself')
end, true)
```
