## MariaDb

While Windows has XAMPP, we'll be using a standalone version of SQL called MariaDB. We will be installing this via shell. 

The first thing that is recommended to do before installing a package is updating your system, we do that with the following command

```
sudo apt-get update
```

<Warning>
Make sure to always use a user that has sudo privileges. On Linux, root accounts have access to everything on the system. It is advised that a specific user has sudo privileges and remote root access is turned off to prevent any incidents related to possible breaches. You can read more about initial Linux security [here](https://blog.avast.com/secure-your-linux-server-avast).
</Warning>

After you've updated your system, it's time to install the MariaDB server. You do so by entering the command below

```
sudo apt-get install mariadb-server
```
Follow the setup that guides you through. There should be a few options that you select with the space key. Eventually, when you've completed the installation, you'll need to run through a secure installation with the command below.

```
sudo mysql_secure_installation
```

The script will prompt you to set up the root user password, remove the anonymous user, restrict root user access to the local machine and remove the test database. At the end the script will reload the privilege tables ensuring that all changes take effect immediately.

All steps are explained in detail and it is recommended to answer ‚ÄúY‚Äù (yes) to all questions.

After you've done the secure installation above, you can then connect to your mysql service via the command below. You log in as the local mysql root user with the password that you've set in the secure installation.

```
mysql -u root -p
```

<Info>
If you've done the secure installation but forgot the root user password, a sudo privileged user can bypass logging into the mysql service by running the command

**sudo mysql -u root**
</Info>

## Creating Admin user

After you've done the steps above, you should now have a fully functional MariaDB service on your server. Congratulations! We now have to set up a user with proper credentials, as well as a database that we'll use for setting up QBCore.

Let's start by creating an administrative user that can handle creation of other users and databases. It is very much advised that the user you're running is not the standard root user, because it has access to everything that goes on with MariaDB.

Open up your mysql instance with the command below

```
mysql -u root -p
```
Once you're in the console, it should look a bit like this

MariaDB Command Line

We will now proceed with creating an administrator user account. Enter the commands as they are seen below in numerical order. You will only need to edit a few things (Such as username, password and host)

```
CREATE USER 'user1'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password1';
(Check the user created by running this line) SELECT User FROM mysql.user;
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON *.* TO 'user1'@localhost IDENTIFIED BY 'password1';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```
<Info>
'user1', localhost and 'password1' variables are all expected to be changed. You can change anything in the 'user1' and 'password1' fields to your desired values as that's what you'll use while logging in.

Localhost is a bit tricky. Since Linux does not natively feature a Desktop Environment, you will most likely access the database with the user remotely. To do so, instead of localhost, enter a % (A % means any host) so it looks as 'user1'@'%' We will be covering how to connect and what ports to open below.
</Info>

## Allowing remote access (DB)

As a default setting, MariaDB and MySQL both only allow connections from the local network. In order to connect to the database with external software (Such as HeidiSQL) and from our PC, we will need to change those settings.

The file that has these settings can be found in /etc/mysql/mariadb.conf.d/50-server.cnf

We open this file using the command sudo `nano 50-server.cnf`, which opens a command line text file editor.

The screenshot below shows you what line needs changing. The default setting will have the bind address set to 127.0.0.1, which only allows local host connections. We will change this to 0.0.0.0 to allow any and all connections to the database.
