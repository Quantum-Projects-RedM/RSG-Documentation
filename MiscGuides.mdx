## Getting the Players

**To get a list of players on the server we must use either a native that is like this**

```lua
for _, player in ipairs(GetActivePlayers()) do
local ped = GetPlayerPed(player)
-- do stuff
end
```

**Using the RSG function you can do it like this**

```lua
for _, player in pairs(RSGCore.Functions.GetPlayers()) do
local ped = GetPlayerPed(player)
-- do stuff
end
```

## Database Connection

<Info>
  txAdmin does this automatically already but if needed then in your server.cfg put this and fill it in with the correct information. For the database wrapper [oxmysql](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql)
</Info>

### Installation[â€‹](https://overextended.github.io/docs/oxmysql/#installation)

* Download the [latest build](https://github.com/overextended/oxmysql/releases/latest) of oxmysql (not the source code).

* Extract the contents of the archive to your resources folder.

* Start the resource near the top of your resources in your `server.cfg`.

* If you have a lot of streamed assets, load them first to prevent timing out the connection.

### [](https://docs.qbcore.org/qbcore-documentation/guides/miscellaneous-guides#configuration)Configuration[â€‹](https://overextended.github.io/docs/oxmysql/#configuration)

You can change the configuration settings by using convars inside your `server.cfg`. Reference the following for an idea of how to set your connection options. You must include one of the following lines, adjusted for your connection and database settings.

```
set mysql_slow_query_warning 150set mysql_debug true
```

Certain special characters are reserved or blocked and may cause issues when used in your password.
For more optional settings (such as multiple statements) you can reference [pool.d.ts](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/blob/master/typings/mysql/lib/Pool.d.ts#L10) and [connection.d.ts](https://github.com/sidorares/node-mysql2/blob/master/typings/mysql/lib/Connection.d.ts#L8).

You can also add the following convars if you require extra information when testing queries.

```
set mysql_slow_query_warning 150set mysql_debug true
```

## Server.cfg

Setting up your server.cfg is really simple and is already completed upon a successful txAdmin recipe install! You can also find additional information on server configuration files [**here**](https://docs.fivem.net/docs/server-manual/setting-up-a-server/)**.** In case of a manual install then here's a template to use

```
