## General Practices

* Localize as many functions and variables as possible. Lua can read them faster



<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Variable Practices" defaultOpen={false} />

  <Accordion title="Native Usage" defaultOpen={false}>
    Always replace `GetPlayerPed(-1)` with `PlayerPedId()`
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Loops" defaultOpen={false}>
    Control your while loops and when they run
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Event Handlers" defaultOpen={false}>
    When setting variables inside your resource, handlers come in especially handy due to not needing to constantly run checks
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security

* A surplus amount of security in a code is not a bad thing. Don't be afraid to add in multiple if checks or create random variables to pass through your events

* Never do any type of transaction with the player regarding money or items on the client side of a resource
